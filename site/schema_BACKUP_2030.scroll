## Terms
* Phenomenon - A term t refers to a phenomenon x if and only if x satisfies the core causal description associated with t.
* Concept - Abstract representations of physical properties of phenomena that can simplify and organize complex information.
* Equation - A mathematical formula that expresses the quantitative relationship between different physical quantities.
* Law - An empirical generalization that has been tested and verified through repeated observation and experimentation, and describes fundamental aspects of nature.
* Principle - A general concept or idea that explains the behavior of physical systems and is often derived from laws.
* Theory - A comprehensive explanation of a particular phenomenon that has been rigorously tested and is widely accepted within the scientific community.
* Hypothesis - A testable prediction or explanation that is used to guide scientific research and inquiry, based on limited evidence or observation.
* Fact - Objective and verifiable pieces of information that are supported by empirical evidence obtained through observation, measurement, or experimentation.
