derivation Starting from the ideal gas law: $PV=nRT$ where $n$ is the number of moles of gas and $R$ is the gas constant. We can rearrange this equation to express $n$ in terms of the number of particles $N$, using Avogadro's constant $N_A$: $n=N/N_A$. Substituting this expression for $n$ into the ideal gas law, we get: $PV=NkT$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, defined as: $k=R/N_A$. Therefore, the Boltzmann equation expresses the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas, and the number of particles of the gas.
